    <h2>How to make Delicious Golden Egg Fried Rice!</h2>
    <p>Make this delicious yet simple recipe with just a few ingredients at home! A nutritious yet filling dish that can be made in just minutes! </p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Did you know, leftover rice is preferred when making fried rice dishes as it is firmer and unlikely to stick for a better eating experience and texture.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Rice</li>
      <li>Cooking Oil</li>
      <li>Sesame Oil</li>

      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Prawns</li>
      <li>Peas</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Have leftover rice ready, and if not, freshly cooked rice is fine, but is generally less preferred.</li>
      <li>Crack some eggs into a bowl, and whisk until beaten well into a smooth and runny consistency.</li>
      <li>Heat the pan to low-medium heat, and start cooking the prawns until halfway cooked.</li>
      <li>When the prawns are halfway cooked, add the rice and start mixing well to prevent it clumping together.</li>
      <li>Add Soy Sauce and mix well together with the rice and prawns.</li>
      <li>Once the soy sauce has been mixed, add the peas and mix with the other ingredients in the pan</li>
